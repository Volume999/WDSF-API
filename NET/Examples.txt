To use the examples prepare the following:

- Competition ID. 
	It can be found by browsing https://sandbox.worlddancesport.org/api/1/competition?status=PreRegistration. Pick any one you like. 
	Preferably one that is part of the WDS World Ranking System so you can see the points given to a couple in example 4.

Allmost all examples start by requesting this ID.

The general work flow of a competition is the following:

1. Register officials -> use "Register Officials" example
2. Register participants -> use "Register Participants" example
3. Upload the results of a competition -> use the "Update results" example
4. Close the competition ->use the "Close competition" example
	This example will close the competition and retreive the coefficient and participant points.

The "Remove results" example shows how to remove results. This is not part of a usual work flow but might be helpfull during testing.
